Patient will continue to check at-home glucose levels and should report to physician if levels are hypoglycemic or if he begins to feel symptoms of hypoglycemia such as lightheadedness. Patient encouraged to modify diet but is reluctant at this time. Check hA1C, renal function panel for signs of end-organ damage related to diabetes. Patient counseled to get eye exam and to self-check for non-healing wounds of the feet. 2. Chronic fatigue: Check CBC and CMP for iron/ electrolyte abnormalities that may be contributing to chronic fatigue. If values are within normal limits, schedule follow-up appointment to explore other etiologies of chronic fatigue. 3. Health maintenance: Patient encouraged to get colonoscopy.

Thinking about it now, it would also be reasonable to get a chest X-ray. If covid test is positive, I would then discuss with him importance of self-isolating for the specified time period. If negative, this is most likely another viral infection so would recommend supportive treatment. However, would want close follow-up in another two weeks to discuss how his symptoms are.

Once we have those numbers, it will be good to change the medications to SGLT2 inhibitors and to address any kidney function issues that may be happening which would depend on albumin and creatinine levels. I wanted to schedule a follow-up with this patient after starting new medications to ensure we are addressing the fatigue and urination frequency so that we can improve the patient's quality of life.
